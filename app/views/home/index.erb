        <h2>Me in a Nutshell</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been obsessed with computers and the internet for what seems like my entire life now.  I look at how far internet and applications have come and know this is something I must to be a part of.  I am an outgoing person, who not only thrives off a team environment but am someone who loves to interact with people in general.  I have the capability of working on my own and taking on the challenge of expanding my understanding of computer programming. 
        </p>

        <p> 
          Beyond just a programmer, I am an avid sports fan and am willing to talk sports all day long.
